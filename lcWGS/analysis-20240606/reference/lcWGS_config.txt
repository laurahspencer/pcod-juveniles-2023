# Remember to provide the full paths to files and directories.
#The reference genome MUST be a fasta with the ".fa" file extension.
#The working directory should contain the list of fastq files and the gzipped fastq files.
# Don't worry about adding modules yourself. The pipeline will check for all needed modules and add them if they are not found.
# If you run into trouble, please contact Laura.Timm@noaa.gov
